# My JavaScript Trivia Game

This deployed website is a trivia game all about JavaScript! Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have created a fun and functional game. The site uses multiple functions to start the game, display each question one at a time, start a timer, check your answer, and create your score. The questions are randomized each time, so no memorizing! This site also lets you restart to try to attain that perfect score. Using local storage, at the end of the game you can save your score to a leader board. This leader board will always show the last players score.
